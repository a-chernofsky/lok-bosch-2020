## Abstract

Baron and Kenny (1986, 92,251 Google Scholar citations, many from the last 10 years) proposed estimators of indirect and direct effects: the
part of a treatment effect that is mediated by a covariate and the part that
is not. Subsequent work on natural indirect and direct effects provides a
formal causal interpretation, based on cross-worlds counterfactuals: outcomes under treatment with the mediator “set” to its value without treatment. Organic indirect and direct effects (Lok 2016) avoid cross-worlds
counterfactuals, using “organic” interventions on the mediator while keeping the initial treatment fixed at “treatment”. Organic indirect and direct
effects apply also to settings where the mediator cannot be “set”. In linear models where the outcome model does not have treatment-mediator
interaction, both organic and natural indirect and direct effects lead to
the same estimators as in Baron and Kenny (1986). Here, we generalize
organic interventions on the mediator to include settings with the initial
treatment fixed at “no treatment”: interventions that are organic for “no
treatment”. We show that the product method holds in linear models for
organic indirect and direct effects relative to “no treatment” even if there is
treatment-mediator interaction. Moreover, we find a product method for
binary mediators. Furthermore, we argue that the organic indirect effect
relative to “no treatment” is very relevant for drug development. We illustrate the benefits of our approach by estimating the organic indirect effect
of curative HIV-treatments mediated by two HIV-persistence measures,
using ART-interruption data without curative HIV-treatments combined
with an estimated/hypothesized effect of the curative HIV-treatments on
these mediators.
